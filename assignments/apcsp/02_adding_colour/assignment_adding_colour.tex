  \begin{questions}

    \BlueQuestion{With value ranges from $0$--$255$ for each component, how many total possible colours can be expressed using the RGB colour model?}

    \BlueQuestion{Without programming them, describe the colours represented by each of the following.}\\
    {\small\textbf{Note:} This question is only looking for general descriptions of the colours.}
      \begin{parts}
        \part \code{fill(255, 0, 255);}
        \part \code{fill(0, 255, 255);}
        \part \code{fill(125, 125, 125);}
      \end{parts}

    %Add color to the Processing Bee!
    \GreenQuestion{Add colour to the Processing Bee from Assignment \#1.}\\
    {\small\textbf{Hint:} Yellow colours predominantly use red and green colour components, with blue being added to bring the colour closer to brown.}

    \GreenQuestion{Why do you think the designers of the Processing language decided there was a need for both a grayscale \code{fill()} method as well an RGB model \code{fill()} method (which can easily be used to express various shades of gray)?}

    %Dart-Board Picture
    \RedQuestion{Use the Processing reference for the \code{arc()} drawing method (https://processing.org/reference/arc\_.html) to assist you in emulating the following image of a dartboard.\\
          {\small\textbf{Warning:} Using only the knowledge we have currently about the Processing language, this is a pretty long, tedious task; however, once you've determined how to draw the individual pieces of the board, the remaining pieces are not difficult to program.}\\
          {\small\textbf{Hint:} Because there are $20$ different ``wedges'' in the dart board, each arc should be $\dfrac{\pi}{10}$ radians wide. The value of $\pi$ is accessible via the \code{PI} keyword in Processing.}

    \YellowQuestion{Explain the iterative process you took in creating your dart board program.}
