    \BlueQuestion{Processing, and many other programming languages, have separate operators for comparing the equality of two values (\code{==}) and for assigning a value to a variable (\code{=}). Briefly discuss the pros and cons of having different operators for these operations.}

      \begin{parts}
        \part if the diameter of the circle is less than $50$, the circle should be coloured \emph{blue},

    %HSB/RGB
    \RedQuestion{The RGB colour model is not the only model used to express different colours in a computer system. Processing also allows us to express colours in a model known as \textbf{H}ue, \textbf{S}aturation, and \textbf{B}rightness (HSB), also sometimes referred to as Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV). Because HSB can be used to express the exact same set of colours as RGB, there is a method for converting between the two. That is, given values for $R$ed, $G$reen, and $B$lue, you can derive $H$ue, $S$aturation, and $Br$ightness using the following algorithm\footnote[2]{This algorithm is adapted from the RapidTables RGB to HSV conversion algorithm found at: http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/rgb-to-hsv.htm.}.}

          \textbf{To Calculate Hue:}
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item First, calculate $Rp$, $Gp$, and $Bp$ such that:
              \[\begin{aligned}
                Rp &= R \div 255\\
                Gp &= G \div 255\\
                Bp &= B \div 255

              \[\begin{aligned}
                max &= max(Rp, Gp, Bp)\\
                min &= min(Rp, Gp, Bp)\\
                d &= max - min
              \end{aligned}\]

                H = \left\{\begin{array}{l r}
                  0, & d = 0\\

                  60 \times \left(\frac{Bp - Rp}{d} + 2\right), & max = Gp\\
                  60 \times \left(\frac{Rp - Gp}{d} + 4\right), & max = Bp

      Write a program that initializes values for \code{R}, \code{G}, and \code{B} and uses the above algorithm to calculate \code{H}, \code{S}, and \code{Br}.

    %Complementary Colors
    \YellowQuestion{\emph{Complementary colours} are colours that appear on opposite sides of the colour wheel. Although the colour wheel was first developed by artists using primary pigment colours (red, blue, and yellow), we can still find a colour complementary to one using the RGB model. In order to do so, it is important to note that the range of \emph{hue} values in the HSB model being $0$--$360$ is no coincidence: hue actually refers to the angle around the colour wheel at which the particular colour appears. The algorithm for finding an RGB modelled colour's complement, therefore, is:}

          \textbf{To Find an RGB Complement:}

            \item Convert from RGB to HSB.

      \begin{parts}
        \part Write a program that initializes values for \code{R}, \code{G}, and \code{B} and uses the above algorithm (omitting Step \#3) to find the colour's complement. Test your program by displaying two squares, side-by-side, the first using a \code{fill()} of the original colour and the second using a \code{fill()} of its complement. Make sure you switch to the HSB \code{colorMode()} before drawing the second square.\\
        {\small\textbf{Hint:} Use your RGB to HSB program from Question \#5.}
        \part Explain why adding $180$ to $H$ in the HSB value finds a colour on the opposite side of the colour wheel.
        \part Explain why the new $H$ value needs to be taken $\mathbf{mod\ } 360$.
