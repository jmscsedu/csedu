    %Errors
    \BlueQuestion{Why do you think \code{size()} needs to be placed before any other drawing methods? What error do you get if you don't place it first?}

    %Basic Use-Case Question
    \BlueQuestion{Describe at least one use-case for using the \code{CENTER} mode for drawing rectangle.}

    %Fix Syntax
    \GreenQuestion{Identify and fix the errors in each of the following.}
      \begin{parts}
        \part \code{size(200, 200;}
        \part \code{background();}
        \part \code{stroke 255;}
        \part \code{fill(150)}
        \part \code{rectMode(center);}
      \end{parts}

    %Basic Drawing
    \GreenQuestion{Draw the following sets of concentric circles and squares.}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{files/Concentric}
    \end{center}

    %Anticipate mathematical operations.
    \YellowQuestion{The keywords \code{width} and \code{height} evaluate to the width and height, respectively, of the drawing canvas. Use these keywords to draw an ellipse with the following requirements:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item centered in the middle of the canvas and
        \item dimensions 75\% of each the width and the height.
      \end{itemize}
      {\small\textbf{Note:} Your program \emph{must} use \code{width} and \code{height} in order to work dynamically for differently sized canvases to receive full credit.}}

    %Emulate a Drawing
    \RedQuestion{Complete each of the following exercises.}
      \begin{parts}
        \part Emulate the following picture of a ``bee'' using the basic Processing drawing methods we've learned so far.
          \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{files/ProcessingBee}
          \end{center}
        \part Use the reference documents for \code{curveVertex()} (https://processing.org/reference/curveVertex\_.html) in order to draw wings on our Processing bee.
